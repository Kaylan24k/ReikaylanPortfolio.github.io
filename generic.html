									<h1>Tech Enthusiast<br /></h1>

									<p>Meet a 13-year-old version of me, wide-eyed and hooked on the dazzling tech extravaganza in Iron Man. <br >
										 Yep, that little adventurer was yours truly, unknowingly stepping into a <br >
										  lifelong love story with computers.<br ><br >

										  Remember Iron Man's Jarvis? He wasn't just some AI. He was the door to a world where tech was more than<br > 
										  flashy gadgets. Fueled by that spark, I dove into a journey – not the neat and tidy kind,<br >
										   but a wild, unpredictable ride that shaped me into a computer scientist.<br ><br >

										  As I navigated the twists and turns of my computer science degree, every project felt like a thrilling rollercoaster<br >
										  ride. Each line of code, a brushstroke on my digital canvas, creating a unique, ever-evolving adventure.<br >
										   In this journey, technology wasn't just a tool; it became a trusted companion<br >
										    on this wonderfully human exploration.</p>

								<h2>As a software engineer<br /></h2>
								<p>I believe in making code that's clear and accessible. While my initial focus is on functionality, I put in the effort to refine my code – adding comments, organizing, and ensuring it's a welcoming space for any collaborator.

									Efficiency and maintainability are my guiding principles. Functional features are great, but I aim for code that's not just a quick fix, it's the kind that stands the test of time and is easy for anyone to manage.
									
									I thrive on new projects, Each one is like a new chapter in my book of learning and growth. Every challenge is a chance to broaden my horizons and add another layer to my expertise.</p>

								<h2>As an Individual<br /></h2>		
								<p>I am a versatile thinker fueled by a relentless work ethic. I thrive in the pulse of time-sensitive scenarios, effortlessly managing intricate projects while still being able to balance a healthy work and social life.

									My university journey paints a vivid picture – collaborative projects, ranging from the thrill of game development to seamlessly integrating AI, and applications that just make life more fun. These experiences have not only polished my technical skills but transformed teamwork into a fine art.
									
									What sets me apart? It's my resilience, my unwavering stance in the face of challenges. Whether decoding an academic puzzle or navigating a real-world task, I dive in with relentless dedication, pouring my heart into every endeavor.</p>

								<h4>I'm ready and excited to work together. Let's connect, share ideas, and create something amazing. Reach out, and let's make innovation happen!</h4>
